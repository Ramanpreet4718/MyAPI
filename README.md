# MyAPI

My first Mock RESTful API

Hello everyone! Here i made my own Mock API that can be used as a mock server, and i deploy it that anyone can access it and use it as there own api. This is thanks to the https://github.com/typicode/json-serverâ€‹ package and https://www.cyclic.sh/ for development and deployment of this api.

Basically this API holds two types of Data :

1. Beauty Bebo Product Data,
2. Medisons and
3. users

This data mainly used in development of Medical Store Websites.

you can access the api by clicking this address : https://concerned-red-jersey.cyclic.app
